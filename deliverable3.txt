What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?
    It was tricky to find out how to initially implement the unit tests. I ended up using pytest instead of the unittest module.

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
    I thought the requirements were interesting and allowed me to solve the problem in my own way. It was clear that there were several ways to accomplish the task, but I appreciated the freedom the problem allowed.

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
    The unittest module was tricky to implement and I had to refresh my memory on certain Python basics (syntax, running the program).

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
    I knew there were sufficient test cases because I had one or more test cases for each possible outcome.
